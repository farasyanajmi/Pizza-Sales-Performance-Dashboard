This repository presents an **end-to-end Business Intelligence project** focused on analyzing pizza sales. It features a Tableau Dashboard (`Pizza Sales.twb`) that is powered by **pre-calculated SQL metrics**, showcasing a complete data pipeline from database extraction to visualization. This solution provides data analysts with actionable insights into revenue, order volume, and key product performance.

2.  **Transformation:** Key performance indicators (KPIs) are defined and calculated directly within the SQL environment.
3.  **Visualization:** Tableau connects to the resulting data set to create dynamic and interactive performance dashboards.
